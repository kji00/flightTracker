## Initial README

PROJECT #2 FlightTracker App


User Story:

As a user I want to be able to find flights to a destination of my choosing along with the price 
	Ex: San Francisco -> New York on March 1, 2023 $400

I want to be able to save the route with the price for the particular date
Save the generated prices +7 days (So prices from March 1 - March 8 should be saved)

I want to be able to save multiple routes to different destinations

I want to track any change in price (whether the price goes up or down) and be notified via email for any saved routes

When I click on the saved routes I should still see all the prices that were saved previously:
Ex: Saved route from SF -> New York on March 1, 2023 was $400
